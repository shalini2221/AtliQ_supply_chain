# AtliQ_supply_chain
Codebasics roll out monthly resume challenges that exercises the business domain knowledge, tech stack skills like SQL, Excel, PowerBI or Tableau. The Aim of the challenge is to give data analysts/enthusiasts an opportunity to test themselves on real world business cases and to be able to work right from extracting data, cleaning the messy data and load it in tool where further calculations and visualizations are carried on. Every month they run new challenges that span over different domains like retail, FMCG, Hardware, IT, sales etc. This challenge gives the basic foundation on which we can build our data career. With onset of individual projects, there's so much to learn.

These challenges are valuable for my growth. And I appreciate codebasics for coming up with such opportunity.

Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.
